        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "File compression reduces the size of files by identifying and eliminating redundant or unnecessary data using various algorithms. The primary purposes are to save storage space, reduce transfer times when sending files over networks or the internet, and bundle multiple files together for easier organization and transfer.

        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Lossless compression reduces file size while preserving all original data, allowing the file to be decompressed exactly as it was before compression. This is essential for documents, programs, and data where any change would cause corruption. Lossy compression permanently removes data deemed less important to achieve higher compression ratios, making it suitable for media files (JPEG images, MP3 audio, MP4 video) where some quality loss is acceptable. Lossy compression cannot be reversed to recover the original file exactly.",

        "explanation": "A .tar.gz or .tgz file is a TAR (Tape Archive) archive that has been compressed using Gzip compression. TAR itself only bundles files together without compression (creating a .tar file), and then Gzip compression is applied to the TAR file. This two-step approach is common in Linux and Unix systems. Other similar formats include .tar.bz2 (TAR compressed with bzip2) and .tar.xz (TAR compressed with xz), each using different compression algorithms with various trade-offs between compression ratio and speed.",

        "explanation": "RAID 5 balances performance and redundancy by striping data across multiple drives and distributing parity information. This approach provides fault tolerance that can survive a single drive failure while using less total storage than mirroring (unlike RAID 1, which requires double the capacity). RAID 5 typically requires at least three drives and offers good read performance, though write performance is slower due to parity calculations.

        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "In a RAID 0 array (striping without parity), data is split across multiple drives to increase performance, but there is no redundancy. If any single drive in the array fails, all data in the entire array becomes inaccessible and is effectively lost. This makes RAID 0 unsuitable for storing important data unless it's backed up elsewhere. RAID 0 should only be used for temporary data, cache files, or scenarios where maximum performance is critical and data loss is acceptable.",
